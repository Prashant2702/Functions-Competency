...Calculationg the nCr...
In this program we are  going to calculate the nCr of a given number.we acn find out the
nCr using the same logic of Factorial using the functions as :
nCr=n!/(n-r)!r!.
So we can done this by defining a function named as fact which is used to find 
the  values for n!,r! and the n-r!.In this we used the for loop.
