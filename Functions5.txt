...Pascal Triangle Problem...
In this program we are going to print out the pascal traingle using the functions.
As in the pascal triangle every number is equal to its binomial coefficients
which is nCr.we can done this by defining afunction named as fact which is used to print out 
the factorial of the number or nCr.
we are using the twofor loops in the main function in which first for loop is for the rows and the scond
one is for the columns.
